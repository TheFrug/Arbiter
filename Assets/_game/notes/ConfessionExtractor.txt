Arbiter is a Confession Extraction Simulator
Interrogator who can employ empathy, intimidation, or insight in order to draw out the truth from arrested individuals. 

Three stats player can set at start of the game and determine success in skill checks a la Disco Elysium
-Empathy (Warmth, building trust, helps in good playthroughs to break down suspect barriers)
-Intimidation (Be fierce, rude, even threatening. Can work quickly, which the state likes. Can also be used in good playthroughs for some key moments)
-Insight (Reading between the lines in people's words/body language. Remembering details.)

Player's goal is to fill out a form, but we can reconfigure what details there are. We have a whole semester, so we can get a little ambitious. 

Gameplay Ideas:

REID Technique - Begin with Factual Analysis, go into Behavior Analysis, can escalate into the 9 step interrogation where a written confession is rendered at the end.

Plea Bargaining 
- Threat of harsher sentence if trial is pursued, with a contrasting reduced sentence for admission of guilt.

Pause Technique - Pausing after suspect answers to illicit further responses
